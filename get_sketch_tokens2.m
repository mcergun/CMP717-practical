% [centers, assignments] = vl_kmeans(X, K)
%  http://www.vlfeat.org/matlab/vl_kmeans.html
%   X is a d x M matrix of sampled SIFT features, where M is the number of
%    features sampled. M should be pretty large! Make sure matrix is of type
%    single to be safe. E.g. single(matrix).
%   'K' is the number of clusters desired (vocab_size)
%   'centers' is a d x K matrix of cluster centers
%   'assignments' is a 1 x M uint32 vector specifying which cluster every
%       feature was assigned to.
%
%   In project 3, we cared about the universal vocabulary specified by
%   'centers'. Here we don't. We care about 'assignments', telling us which
%   sketch tokens (and therefore which image features) correspond to the
%   same mid level boundary structure. We will keep 'centers' only for the
%   sake of visualization.

% Only cluster the Sketch Patches which have center pixel boundaries.
