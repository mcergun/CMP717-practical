% 'img_features' is N x feature dimension. You probably want it to be
% 'single' precision to save memory. 
% 'labels' is N x 1. labels(i) = 1 implies non-boundary, labels(i) = 2
% implies boundary or sketch token 1, labels(i) = 3 implies sketch token 2,
% etc... max(labels) should be num_sketch_tokens + 1;

%feature_params.CR = radius of the channel-derived patches. E.g. radius of
%7 would imply 15x15 features. The other entries of feature_params are for
%calling 'compute_daisy', but the starter code simply has the default
%DAISY values (which do work OK).

% [centers, assignments] = vl_kmeans(X, K)
%  http://www.vlfeat.org/matlab/vl_kmeans.html
%   X is a d x M matrix of sampled SIFT features, where M is the number of
%    features sampled. M should be pretty large! Make sure matrix is of type
%    single to be safe. E.g. single(matrix).
%   'K' is the number of clusters desired (vocab_size)
%   'centers' is a d x K matrix of cluster centers
%   'assignments' is a 1 x M uint32 vector specifying which cluster every
%       feature was assigned to.
%
%   In project 3, we cared about the universal vocabulary specified by
%   'centers'. Here we don't. We care about 'assignments', telling us which
%   sketch tokens (and therefore which image features) correspond to the
%   same mid level boundary structure. We will keep 'centers' only for the
%   sake of visualization.

% Only cluster the Sketch Patches which have center pixel boundaries.
